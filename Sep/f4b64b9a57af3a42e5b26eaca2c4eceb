Nagomba E is no longer young; her hip is giving her trouble and her back is stooped from years of bending over her corn and rice fields. Yet every morning, at the crack of dawn, the wiry 74-year-old sets out on a strenuous half-hour walk to fetch water from a nearby river so that her ailing husband can take a bath. Despite her limp, Nagomba moves fast and with the sure-footedness of a mountain goat.

But the water is often bad , she says. You cannot even use it for bathing. Besides, she adds, if you oversleep, you are there till noon , waiting for a turn at the pump.

Before coal was discovered in Mwabulambo, a remote rural community of Karonga District in northern Malawi, water was never something Nagomba and her neighbours would have to worry about or even line up for. I used to have two taps right at my house, Nagomba says, with running water in the kitchen and bathroom.

I used to have two taps right at my house, Nagomba says, with running water in the kitchen and bathroom. But then heavy trucks moved in -- which turned out to belong to a mining company. The company, with government s approval, claimed her land, forced her to relocate to the edge of the coal field further south, and tore down her house. With it went the taps and water pipes. That was almost nine years ago. Since then, the coal mine, which Nagomba and her neighbours hoped would bring progress and development, has mainly caused regression, hazards, and hardship.

Over the past decade, Malawi, one of the world s poorest countries, has promoted private investment in mining and resource extraction as a way to grow and diversify its largely agriculture-based economy. Karonga, where Nagomba lives, is the country s test case for industrial mining. Malawi s first uranium mine and two of the country s biggest coal mines are located here, on the western shores of Lake Malawi. The government said the mines would provide jobs and improve people s livelihoods. Schools were promised, and clinics as well as boreholes to restore access to drinking water. Hardly any of these promises ever materialised.

When strangers knocked on her door during the 2008 rainy season and told her that she would have to move to make room for a coal mine, Nagomba was taken by surprise. Nagomba, who supported three grandchildren and her sick husband with the income from farming a small but fertile plot of land, eventually accepted the inevitable, thinking that she would get a lot of money . She never asked how much, however. As it turned out, the compensation was not even enough to rebuild her house. The family had to sell two cows to put a roof over their heads again. She received no money for the land itself. It was customary land that her family had farmed for generations, but for which they held no individual title.

In Mwabulambo alone, more than 30 households were relocated from their customary land between 2008 and 2015, when the mining company suspended operations. At times, the bulldozers moved in so fast that people had neither time to rebury their loved ones interred on the community s land, nor to finish reconstructing their homes. One family spent weeks sleeping under a tree before they could move into their rebuilt house. Over the years, Nagomba s story repeated itself again and again in the mining areas of Karonga.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water, water testing results from 2015 indicated that the water in the open pits is acidic and therefore harmful to human health. 2016 Lauren Clifford-Holmes for Human Rights Watch Photo: Open pit filled with water at Eland coal mine, Mwabulambo.

The government had the water tested last year. These tests confirmed that the water is acidic, the deputy director for water quality at the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water told Human Rights Watch, which means that it is neither safe for consumption nor for bathing. But the results have never been made public. Children regularly swim in the pits behind Nagomba s house. And no signs warn of the dangers these pools pose to human health.

The river Nagomba depends on flows into Lake Malawi, a fragile ecosystem and a key source of livelihood for more than 1.5-million people. More than 10 extraction projects are located on the lake s shores and tributaries, which are protected UNESCO World Heritage sites. Not all are active yet. But the risks these mining activities pose to the lake s ecosystem and to the bordering communities health and livelihoods are enormous without proper government oversight.
