Annelie de Wet was a “corporate princess” with a good job in e-commerce, friends, a house in the suburbs – a regular life. Then, 13 years ago, something happened. Hosted by Daily Maverick’s MARIANNE THAMM.   Driving in her neighbourhood one day, Annelie de Wet felt strangely drawn to a woman she saw walking, carrying parcels. She stopped and offered her a lift. The woman refused, saying she was looking for her children. Annelie drove on but for reasons she couldn’t explain, she couldn’t resist going out and finding the woman again. Something she did four more times that same day. As she drove, she felt something shift deep within her consciousness. What was happening to her? And why was this woman so important? Desperate, she phoned a friend. The friend said she thought she knew what was going on. Annalie had a calling – to become a Sangoma.
