Public servants are required to abide by oversight requirements of Parliament at all times, without any exception, the Presidency said on Friday. The management and staff of government departments as well as board members, management and staff of state-owned entities and companies are all accountable to Parliament for the functions assigned to their Ministers. "All public entities and departments were reminded to respect the other arms of the state, the Judiciary and Parliament," he said. They are required to co-operate with the two institutions, guided by the Constitution and the law of the land. The Presidency s message follows the SABC board s decision not to co-operate with Parliament s inquiry into the board s fitness to hold office. Executive members including Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe, acting CEO James Aguma, and chief executive of corporate affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng, walked out of the inquiry on Tuesday. Maguvhe, the last remaining board member, on Tuesday launched a late appeal against the High Court's decision to dismiss his request for an interdict last week. Both the president and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa fulfilled their responsibilities to Parliament in full and with respect, the Presidency said on Friday when calling for public servants to co-operate.
