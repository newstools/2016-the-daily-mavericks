Traditional and Khoi-San Leadership Bill (TKLB) The Communal Land Rights Act, which was struck down by the Constitutional Court in 2010, provided that traditional leaders would administer and control all land within their tribal boundaries which exist wall-to-wall within the former homelands.

The Traditional Courts Bill, which was rejected by Parliament in 2014, would have empowered traditional leaders to strip anyone within their tribal boundaries of customary rights, including land rights, and would have made it a criminal offence to ignore a summons from a traditional leader.

We ve been there before. The difference since 1994 is that the Framework Act shifted the basis of differentiation away from race, to geographical tribal boundaries. These boundaries are, however, steeped in race. They are the outcome of the 1913 Land Act combined with the forced removal of over three-and-half-million back people during the process of Bantustan consolidation. We ve been there before.

The current Framework Act over-rides people s right to define their own customary identities or affiliate with the leaders of their choice. This is particularly problematic in the northern parts of the country where Bantustan consolidation and forced removals violently reconfigured the landscape from the 1960s, through to the 1980s. The Framework Act beds down the geographical outcome of this violent history, confirming the official recognition of chiefs appointed during apartheid, and the tribes created for them.

But recognising traditional leaders is very different to giving them powers. The Communal Land Rights Act and the Traditional Courts Bill would have given them specific powers in respect of the land and people within those boundaries, but neither could pass constitutional muster. So some traditional leaders, and specific parts of government have found ways to stretch the meaning of the Framework Act to imply that it gives traditional leaders the sole authority to represent rural communities in investment deals on communal land.

Rural people are having none of it. They insist that customary law requires chiefs to be accountable, that their authority derives from the people, not Government Gazette notices. They cite their basic rights as South African citizens, including freedom of association and assembly, and the land rights recognised by section 25 of the Constitution. And when their cases reach the Constitutional Court, they invariably win. Rural people are having none of it.

The problem is that it can take years for a case to percolate up from the lower courts, where magistrates and judges tend to default to apartheid customary law precedents that the Constitutional Court has rejected as distortions of living practice, both past and present.

As the claim to unilateral chiefly power becomes more legally precarious, so those who rely on it resort increasingly to violence, with the police noticeably absent. Examples include Xolobeni, where anti-mining activist Sikhosipi Bazooka Radebe was assassinated in March and journalists covering his funeral were violently assaulted in public view, yet no arrests have been made.

Last month at Marikana, anti-corruption activists were attacked with pangas by thugs linked directly to the Traditional Council that traded the community s royalty rights for shares in the ailing Lonmin mining company. The activists include descendants of people who bought the land, but who now find themselves denied a share of any revenue from the platinum mining taking place on their land.

The Public Protector recently confirmed that R600-million was missing from their Bapo ba Mogale tribal account held by North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo s office.

These examples are the tip of an iceberg of disputes over failures of accountability and missing mining revenue. At the heart of such conflicts is the question whether traditional leaders have the power to unilaterally negotiate mining deals that displace people and destroy their land, keeping secret the terms of the deals and where the revenue goes.

Various traditional leaders and some in government clearly believe they do, and advise mining companies accordingly. Matthew Chadwick of Anglo Platinum said in June that the company negotiated a R175-million final settlement agreement with Kgosi David Langa because it was required by law to negotiate with traditional leaders.

Chadwick is mistaken. There is no such law. In fact, the Interim Protection of Informal Land Rights of 1996 requires the opposite. It says that except by expropriation, individuals and families may not be deprived of informal land rights, specifically including customary rights in former homelands, unless they consent.

When the Framework Bill was debated in Parliament in 2003, two safety mechanisms were included to address the risk that illegitimate apartheid structures would be entrenched. One was a commission to settle disputes about tribal boundaries and the legitimacy of incumbent traditional leaders; the other was a requirement that 40% of traditional council members must be elected and 30% must be women. Both have failed spectacularly.
