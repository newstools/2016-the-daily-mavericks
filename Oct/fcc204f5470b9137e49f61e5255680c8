Campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said the award-winning British singer, who can't vote in the United States, is "100 percent for Hillary Clinton," adding: "I love her. She's amazing." Merrill says Adele told the audience that while she is British, "what happens in America affects me too." Clinton turns 69 on Wednesday. Reporters were not allowed to join Clinton for her concert treat -- so we don't yet know whether the White House hopeful belted out a few of her Adele favorites in the dark. On a possibly wackier note, the former top US diplomat and ex-senator hours earlier appeared on a Spanish-language entertainment show, where she shared her favorite recipe for chocolate chip cookies. Hosts of the Univision show "El gordo y la flaca," gave Clinton a bottle of tequila to celebrate the last year of her sixties. mdl/mdo 1994-2016 Agence France-Presse
