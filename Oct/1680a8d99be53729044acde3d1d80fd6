The results slightly exceeded the median analyst expectation of 6.6 percent in an AFP poll. "The general performance was better than expected," the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement. "The national economy grew steadily with made and quality improved." The figure keeps China on track to meet Beijing's target of 6.5-7.0 percent growth for this but comes amid warnings that authorities have relied too much on easy credit, increasing financial risks. "We must be aware that the economic development is still in a critical period of transformation and upgrading, with old drivers of growths to be replaced by new ones," the NBS said. With "a number of unstable and uncertain domestic and external factors", it added, "the foundation of continued economic growth is not solid enough." China's industrial output growth eased to 6.1 percent on-year in September, down from 6.3 percent in August, government data also showed Wednesday, as sluggish global demand weighed on the world's biggest trader in goods. Fixed-asset investment rose 8.2 percent in the first nine months of the year, while retail sales rose 10.7 percent on-year last month, representing a slight acceleration from August. - / / 1994-2016 Agence France-Presse
