The group had gathered at Church Square on Thursday morning, waiting for more students to join them. Less than 500 people were marching along Madiba Street. The group sang struggle songs and danced as they marched to the Union Buildings. Police were keeping a close watch on the protest. They held placards, some of which read "Blade must fall" and "Free education for all". Pupils wearing their school uniforms had also joined the march. Earlier, Tshwane Metro Police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said the group had not been granted permission to march and that the march would be considered illegal. If students marched despite this, a case would be opened. He would not clarify whether officers would move against the protesters. "Any operational decision might be taken. We cannot disclose at this stage what decision may be taken, but any operational decision might be taken at that point," Mahamba said. The march was expected to begin at 08:00, but was delayed as students from other campuses were yet to be bused into town. News 24
