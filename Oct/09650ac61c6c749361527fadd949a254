There is something gut-wrenchingly awful about watching a rape trial. It creates a twisting and a turning, a cold nausea that worms its way around you, and sits in the pit of your stomach. Even if the people are completely unknown to you, the descriptions, the mess of it, the irrationality and the combination of those two most ancient of human behaviours, lust and violence, is something possessing an awful power.

It is the details that are so disturbing, the nudges and winks before, the noncommittal shrugs that really mean no , the refusal to accept it, the colours of the sheets, the use of the word penetration and then the awful questions about how long it took for the victim to realise what had happened.

And for a reporter, one of the most difficult aspects about a rape trial involving politics is that then, as now, almost every aspect is contested. Is the person who was attacked a rape victim or a rape survivor ? What if she feels she is a victim at one point and a survivor at another? And if you use either during a trial are you not immediately ascribing guilt to the accused? Is it penetration , or sex , or intercourse , or sleep with ? There are a million ways to describe the sexual act, but none of them adequately describes an act in which a man s penis enters a woman s vagina in a circumstance in which it is not known if the woman gave permission.

I didn t really know Jacob Zuma when his rape trial started; all I knew about him had come through the unfortunate prism of the Schabir Shaik trial. Famously, Zuma was on trial in that case almost as much as Shaik. And of course, I knew next to nothing about Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo. Even her name is now contested. Should I call her Kuzwayo, in a bid to humanise her, to acknowledge that she was more than just a victim or a survivor or the woman who accused Zuma of rape ? Or should it be the more familiar, more personal, but perhaps disrespectful Fezekile ? In the case, I made sure not to write down her real name. I was worried that under pressure on air I might one day just drop it into a live report, and the best way to make sure that did not happen was to simply not know the name at all.

There are many aspects to the trial that people have forgotten now. The headline of course is that Zuma was acquitted. If you spend any more time on Google, you will probably come across what the judge actually said about Zuma and his behaviour, that and if you can control your body and your sexual urges, then you are a man, my son .

Before the trial even started, a senior judge, then a Deputy Judge President of the South Gauteng High Court, Judge Jeremiah Shongwe, had to recuse himself from the case. This was not because he knew of anything about the details, but because he knew everything there was to know about Zuma. His sister had had a child by him . Two years ago, Shongwe was appointed yes, by Zuma to the position of chair of the Electoral Court.

Just to be clear, the person who could have to decide who wins the elections in 2019 is the uncle of one of Zuma s children.

They were going to smear Kuzwayo. In his plea explanation, read out in open court on the first day, Advocate Kemp J. Kemp said that one of their defences was going to be that the accuser had made claims of rape before. For the second half of the trial, man after man came to testify on this aspect. It was awful to watch. Particularly because their stories were undeniably true. No matter what one thinks of Zuma s behaviour, this was a problem for the prosecution, and it was virtually impossible for them to surmount it.

In the eyes of the law. But the law and sex are a terrible mixture. The law is precise, it uses hard, strictly defined words. Sex is messy, chaotic, difficult. The one thing that stays with me from that time is the realisation of this. From then on I have always thought that actually the whole way the law approaches rape is wrong. If two people have sex in a glass room, and a hundred people watch them, you will probably have a hundred different views on what actually happened; whether it was completely consensual or not. Sex is grey, the law insists on black and white. And it insists on this because you are either guilty or not guilty, free or sent to jail for 15 years.

It must change because the low rate of convictions for rape is directly ascribable to this. We need to think again about how we manage it. And we need to start from scratch, we need to change approach. We need to consider findings that range from he took advantage to he took advantage with aggravating circumstances all the way to proper forcible rape . It will be a difficult process and judges should maybe have more leeway in these cases than in others, precisely because the circumstances can vary so much. This should change. It must change.

He had intercourse, this time resulting in a baby, with Sonono Khoza. Who is the daughter of Irvin Khoza. Again, a woman much younger than him. Again, bringing embarrassment and shame to his party.
