The group stood singing and chanting outside the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court on Wednesday morning, shortly after Dlamini s appearance. They also held up placards which read Hands off Dlamini . A small contingent of police could be seen across the road. There were about five police cars as well as a police nyala monitoring the group along Ntemi Piliso Street. Police asked the group to move or else they would be forced to move in and disperse them. However, the police promised not to shoot at anyone. 'Not in the interest of justice' Earlier, the #FeesMustFall leader and former Wits SRC president was denied bail. Magistrate Albertus Roux told the court it was necessary to weigh up Dlamini s freedom. It's not only the interest of the applicant but the community. The applicant was actively involved in the #FeesMustFall movement at Wits. Roux also said Dlamini s evidence in his affidavit was not convincing . The applicant was not always friendly and honest with the court. He lied about a test that he needed to write, it was discovered that he was not registered for the set course and no test was scheduled. "It is not in the interest of justice to release the applicant where exceptional circumstances exist, it will not ensure the safety and the security of the public. [The] court is satisfied that it would not be in the interest of justice to grant bail." The case was postponed to November 10 and was expected be transferred to the High Court in Johannesburg. Shortly after the court adjourned, the group vowed to shut down the Johannesburg CBD on Wednesday night. News24
