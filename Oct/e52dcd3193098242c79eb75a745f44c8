On Sunday the Sunday Times ran with a story that the ANC s caucus of MPs in Parliament had been asked to interrogate why they had made the decisions they had over Nkandla. It is important to remember how far the ANC in the National Assembly went in protecting Zuma during this particular scandal. There was an ad hoc committee to discuss the sadly departing Public Protector s report, and the finding that Zuma should pay back the money that had been spent by government on his private home(stead). The committee was dominated by ANC members. And they did everything they could to protect Zuma.

Now, at the start of the ANC s caucus meeting over the weekend, the ANC s chief whip, Jackson Mthembu, is quoted as saying in a report: Now, at the start of the ANC s caucus meeting over the weekend, the ANC s chief whip, Jackson Mthembu, is quoted as saying in a report: Now, at the start of the ANC s caucus meeting over the weekend, the ANC s chief whip, Jackson Mthembu, is quoted as saying in a report: The midterm lekgotla needs to interrogate how we as the ANC component in Parliament voted and passed a report on the security upgrades in the President s homestead that the Constitutional Court declared invalid and unconstitutional, which brought our credibility into question .

Well, Mr Mthembu, it s pretty easy to work out what happened. Zuma leaned on Luthuli House, Luthuli House leaned on people who should have known better, and the result was plain to see. In the loss of Joburg, Tshwane and Nelson Mandela Bay. Well, Mr Mthembu, it s pretty easy to work out what happened.

In the loss of Joburg, Tshwane and Nelson Mandela Bay. But for Mthembu to say this could suggest several things. The first is that perhaps, just perhaps, some people in the ANC have had enough, and are now prepared to say so. Many of the ANC s MPs are impressive people, people with histories, back-stories and accomplishments (some of course, are not Des van Rooyen was an MP described as mediocre by people of his own party before suddenly becoming a minister in dubious circumstances, or Peace Mabe appears to have committed fraud by being sworn in as a councillor in Mogale City while an MP, and then when she lost the mayoral council election, decided that the return to Parliament is not such a bad idea. These are only the latest examples, of course.) If you are someone with a working political brain, you would surely realise that this kind of behaviour in protecting someone like Zuma cannot continue. If you are loyal to the ANC you would realise the damage done to the party. If we ascribe even the most selfish of motives to ANC MPs it would indicate that they should be worried they ll simply be out of a job if this continues.

There is also another possibility. Mthembu, despite his long stay in politics, is an honest man. Sometimes his job is to come into a situation to clean up the mess. He has tried to deal with Hlaudi Motsoeneng, and he is believed in his action b ecause he is known to be honest. This is a virtue that right now can be used by the ANC. When a situation has reached the point where it just has to give up and start again, Mthembu is the right person to go to face the cameras and admit they were wrong, and explain how they were going to fix it. It is a tactic, a way of moving on after admitting a mistake. He also played no real role in what happened in the past around Nkandla, which makes it easier. There is also another possibility.

She is probably second only to Julius Malema in giving Zuma grief. The Nkandla findings were probably the lowest point of his presidency (and that is saying something).

This is an incredible statement. Of course, Mantashe had to go to the dinner, and of course he had to say nice things about Madonsela. Anything less would have been noticed and would have looked very churlish. It s one of those moments when the ANC has to look big in public.

Ten days ago the ANC first said that it wanted him and the SABC s nonsensical board out of office. It instructed its MPs on the Communications Committee to make this happen. To make the point, Mthembu even changed some of the ANC s members on that committee to strengthen it ahead of the meeting with the board.

And could, perhaps, this be the start of a much bigger dynamic, something that actually leads to real political action? Either he is not well, or it is because Zuma has his back. And if that is the case, what does that mean for the relationship between Zuma and the ANC?

And could, perhaps, this be the start of a much bigger dynamic, something that actually leads to real political action? We should not be surprised that there is a growing gap between Zuma and the rest of the ANC. Their interests were once aligned, but this is no longer. His interests do not appear to lie in actual governance, and in finding solutions to problems like funding higher education, growing the economy and a better life for anyone but himself. The ANC s interests now lie very much in all of those issues, because they could be out of power in 2019. We should not be surprised that there is a growing gap between Zuma and the rest of the ANC.

And yet, this is a process which did not the start only recently. It began at least as early as December last year, when Zuma fired Nhlanhla Nene (and then lied about the reasons for it). The ANC was clearly not consulted on the decision and was as shocked as anyone else. There is no reason to think this gap would close through any actions by Zuma ever since.

It is also not the first time it has happened. There are some resonances with what happened towards the end of Thabo Mbeki s second term. He seemed to drift away from what was really happening in the ANC. And look how that ended. It is also not the first time it has happened.

It seems to mean that, like Hlaudi, Zuma can act with a kind of impunity. It means that the party s attempts to improve governance are likely to fail. It means that we are living in a time of contestation between the man who is the President and the party that governs the country. It is unlikely to lead to stable policy. Big decisions; higher education funding, the nuclear power build programme, trying to limit red tape for businesses, everything, will likely remain in a kind of slowly decaying stasis.
