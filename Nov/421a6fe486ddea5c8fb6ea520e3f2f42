A lively, rollercoaster game in windy Cape Town saw United and City lead before Lebogang Manyama secured maximum points for the hosts through a 76th-minute goal. Victory took Cape Town one point above Johannesburg-based Wits, who have a home league fixture Wednesday against lowly Highlands Park. In another match, Zimbabwean Tendai Ndoro scored his ninth Premiership goal this season as Orlando Pirates luckily edged Chippa United 1-0 in Port Elizabeth. And Ajax Cape Town completed a profitable night for clubs from the south-western city by winning for the first time this season, 3-2 away to Platinum Stars in north-west mining town Rustenburg. Pirates climbed one place to fifth behind Cape Town, Wits, Golden Arrows and SuperSport United while Ajax moved off the bottom of the table, a position now occupied by Free State Stars. Cape Town City were formed last June when they bought the franchise of Mpumalanga Black Aces, a team from north-eastern city Nelspruit who finished fourth last season. Manyama was among the Aces' stars who moved to Cape Town and former South Africa midfielder Eric Tinkler, freed as Pirates coach after a trophy-less season, was put in charge. The newcomers made a dream start, defeating glamour club Kaizer Chiefs in a knockout competition and are poised to reach the League Cup final this weekend. Kenyan Brian Onyango rocked City by scoring early for Maritzburg and Lehlohonolo Majoro levelled midway through the opening half. Sibusiso Masina put Cape Town ahead less than one minute into the second half only for Zimbabwean Evans Rusike to equalise via an unstoppable free-kick. Slack marking when the ball was crossed allowed to notch his fifth Premiership goal and give City a sixth win in 10 championship outings. Ndoro tapped in a cross on 21 minutes as Pirates maintained a perfect all-competitions record after three matches under Peruvian caretaker coach Augusto Palacios. str-dl/ea 1994-2016 Agence France-Presse
