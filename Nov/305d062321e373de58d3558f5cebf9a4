"The discussion going forward is possibly boycotting exams," student leader Busisiwe told News24 shortly after judgment was handed down. said students were also looking at different avenues including deference until January. "It s very disappointing and disheartening. The reality is students are traumatised and they are suffering post-traumatic stress disorder from all the violence. It is an act of bad faith from the university. It shows that they don t care about future of students. All we are asking for is more time to prepare. "The academic programme ended last week. Many of students needed information which they did not get from these lectures. Students were being attacked from their own residencies; it s not a conducive place to study." A group of students brought an urgent application to interdict examinations to allow them more time to prepare. The students also filed an application to be accommodated in residence until the date of their deference. Wits spokesperson Shirona Patel confirmed that both applications were dismissed. The first exam was completed on Thursday morning, she said. News24
