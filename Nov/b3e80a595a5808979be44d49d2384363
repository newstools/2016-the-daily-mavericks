Wisani sjambokked 24-year-old Nosipho to death at their home in in September last year. She died on the scene as a result of her injuries. Wisani denied he assaulted her. He also denied that there had been an argument between himself and the deceased. Wisani was subsequently arrested for her death and released on bail pending further investigation into the matter. During this time he allegedly threatened and assaulted two State witnesses and as a result his bail was revoked. Judge Mohamed Ismail said he had looked at the totality of the evidence presented during the trial before making his decision. He said the court rejected the accused's version of events. Ismail said , who had opted to conduct his own defence throughout the proceedings, should obtain legal representation for his sentencing. Dressed in black jeans, a blue T-shirt with white stripes and a green jacket, Wisani took notes as the judgment was read out. The gallery was filled with members of the Stop Violence Against Women Abuse project in purple T-shirts. Wisani was the chairperson of an ANC Youth League branch in the inner Johannesburg area prior to his arrest. News24
