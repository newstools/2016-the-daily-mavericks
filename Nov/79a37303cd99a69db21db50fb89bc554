The Speaker s office confirmed on Tuesday that the motion of no confidence against Zuma would be debated in the National Assembly on Thursday. In a letter to the DA, deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli said the decision was made after consultation with the leader of government business and the ANC chief whip. I wish to inform you the motion is scheduled for November 10, Tsenoli said in the letter, sent on Tuesday. Maimane said Parliament had elected the president and had the power to remove him. South Africa has united in a manner never before seen in our democracy, in order to see Jacob Zuma and his circle of corrupt cronies be removed, once and for all, Maimane said on Tuesday. The motion was non-partisan and would afford all 400 MPs a chance to speak for the people, he said. Jacob Zuma has wreaked havoc on our infant democracy, causing us to go backwards. 783 charges of corruption, Nkandla, the Al-Bashir saga, the Guptas, state capture, the list is endless. News24
