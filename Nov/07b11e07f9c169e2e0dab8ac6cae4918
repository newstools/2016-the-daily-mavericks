The defeat matched Pirates' worst-ever defeat - 27 years ago to Mamelodi Sundowns in a BP Top 8 encounter. Chairperson Irvin Khoza revealed that the former Ajax Cape Town mentor e-mailed his resignation in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Khoza admits that he "would have loved it if he had engaged me first before he released his frustration". After Tuesday night's match, Pirates are seventh in the league with 10 points. "Yesterday evening in the [post-match] interview, the coach gave an indication that he's disappointed with the result and (will) see the chairman today in order to discuss his future," Khoza said at the press conference. "When I woke up this morning, the coach sent me an e-mail which I ll read for the media: 'Dear president, after the disastrous performance from us against SuperSport yesterday evening I believe that the team needs new impulse to stabilise the performances therefore my suggestion to be released from my duties. It is shameful for a club of this magnitude to lose without pride and dignity. I feel sorry and regret not being able to turn around. " Khoza continued: "I was left with no option because unfortunately for him and for us his given an indication to the media even before he discussed the matter with us. "Usually it is not easy for me to just accept a coach s resignation. We always give them support."
