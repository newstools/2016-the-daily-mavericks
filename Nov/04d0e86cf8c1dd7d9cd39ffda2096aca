A large crowd filled the square as the marchers waited for more buses of supporters to arrive. Some were resting on the lawns in small groups while others were preparing food to sell. An EFF truck entertained supporters with music as a group formed a circle and danced and whistled. Earlier on Wednesday morning a small group of supporters marched in the streets. Some EFF members lay in the streets as part of the demonstration. They sang, "Voetsek, Fokof" and held aloft placards reading "FeesMustFall" as they blocked traffic to the fury of road users. The march had initially been planned to show support for Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan after he was charged with fraud by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). NPA head Shaun Abrahams since withdrawn the charges against Gordhan, former Sars boss Oupa Magashula and former Sars deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay. An application by President Jacob Zuma to interdict the release of the Public Protector's report on "state capture" was expected to continue in the High Court in Pretoria on Wednesday. News24
