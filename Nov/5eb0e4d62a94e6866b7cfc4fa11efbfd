The interview with the EWN journalist was recently leaked and posted on YouTube. "It has come to our attention that Stephen Grootes reported on 21st November 2016 that 'Ajay Gupta lied' pursuant to an interview conducted on 16th February 2016," the family said in a statement. "Let it be recorded that Grootes' allegation is noted but categorically denied." Grootes said he had conducted literally thousands of interviews during his career but that the interview with Gupta was the toughest. Some of Gupta's answers seemed to have been blatant lies, particularly his claims around ministers Des van Rooyen and Mosebenzi Zwane. "Of course, we didn't have the 'state capture' report ," Grootes said. The Gupta family said "appropriate steps" would be taken against the journalist. "The rights of Ajay Gupta are reserved and appropriate steps will be taken against Grootes in the appropriate forum. Grootes is also invited to substantiate his false, defamatory claim," said the family. News24
